More Work!
Foreign Trade Meet Providing It
for You! More Business: Profits
More work! Even the pu/ï¬nj locomotives along
the docks seemed to echo it Tuesday.
EDITORIAL
LE;\DERS of industry on two â€˜continents were
gathering at The Olympic Hotel today for the
opening of the 12th National Foreign Trade conven
tion, opening Wednesday. It's the biggest gathering
of its kind in the world.
â€œBuilding world tradeâ€ is one of the phrases about
the Jlobbies. â€˜â€œExpansion of ' foreign markets for
American productsâ€ is another. â€œOpportunities for
American goods in the Orientâ€ 1s a third. But it all
boils down toâ€”
More work in Seattle! More work thruout the
country!
Men whose genius has built enormous manufactur
ing plants sat in the lobby and talked about that.
Men whose products, carrving the â€œmade in Americaâ€
label, sail out of Seattle for ports of the seven seas,
wrinkled their brows over how to get it.
w . -
OPâ€™Iâ€˜I'IN the conversations were interrupted by the
screeching of whistlesâ€”deep-throated blasts from
incoming or departing liners, or the sharper warning
toots of shunting locomotives.
They, too, busy distributing the goods of the men
who sat in conference at The Olympic Hotel, seemed
to echo the glad tidings of greater prosperity to come.
v L] -~
TIIE mandin-thestreet and the mandinthe-factory were not pres
ent at the convention. Neither were their wives representedâ€”
the wives who wilt be able to afford better clothes and better
homes if the convention's work is successfnl,
But while the men who do the work and the women who back
them up were keeping the wheels turning, leaders of industry were
planning to make America's factory wheels turn faster, to beat the
world to new markets, planning to make it possible for workmen
to earn more dollars per year.
â€œ Â» Bl Â£
THERE was no â€œrnlerah stuffâ€ about the delegates, They are
not of the common â€œboosterâ€ type. They know what they're
talking about; the chart of Americaâ€™s foreign trade for the years
to come Is as clear in their minds ns the way home is In yours,
And they said the prospects were that Seattleâ€™s trade would grow
steadily; that this great gateway fo the East would see a steady
Incrense, year after year, of ships sailing outhound with products
manufactured from here to New York. They saw no boom times
ahead, with their resultant slumpsâ€”but they did see a calmly ris
ing sun of prosperity for Seattle and Puget Sound,
. L . Â»
SO THEY stroll around at the Olympie, red-badged
and blue-badged, and talk of â€œopportunities.â€
And what it all means, boiled down, is â€œmore work
for the man-in-the-streetâ€ and better times ahead for
his wife and children.

Trade Delegates Here
for 12th Convention
| By Jim Marshall
Ã© SEA'Iâ€™TLE became the hub of the world Tuesday.
> From far-flung outposts of civilization over the seven seas: from bus
tling Eastern centers; from China, India, Belgium, a dozen nations, the men
who make the worldâ€™s wheels turn came here for the Twelfth National Foreign
â€˜Trade convention, opening Wednesday. |
Their purpose was to make Americaâ€™s wheels of commerce turn faster. Those
who gathered had no airy dreams of id ealistic visions concerning methods.
Theï¬ knew, |
The convention is the first of its kind ever held in the Pacific Northwest.
More than 1,600 delegates are expected. Many already are here. i
Roster of the delegates reads like a Who's Who of World ' â€”â€”
Leaders. Foremost is James A. Farrell, president of the
mighty United States Steel corporation. J. Butler Wright,
assistant secretary of state, is coming. Our own Dean
ILewin, of the university, acknowledged business expert,
\is ready. From all over America the men who make things |
(and send them in a thousand ships to far lands will discuss |
for three days how to make more things for more ships. I
And they will pay special attention to Seattleâ€”gateway |
to the teeming Orient, where millions wait for American |
manufactured goods. They will talk of â€œmissionary workâ€ |
to be done over there; of competitorsâ€™ tactics to be circum- |
vented ; of shipping and of markets, I
Five special trains from East and South are due in Se-l
|attle Tuesday and early Wednesday., They are carrying |
Imore than 500 delegates. Californiaâ€™s delegation got in, |
150 strong, Tuesday morning. Six special cars filled withl
Eastern leaders are to arrive over the Great Northern:
Tuesday night. The Milwaukee is bringing scores of others. |
Frank Branch Riley will head a Portland delegation to
arrive early Wednesday. There are 200 Oregonians in this |
iparty. Two more parties from the East will arrive, at 6:80
iover the Union Pacific and at 7 over the Northern Pacific
Wednesday.
Large Japanese and Chinese delegations featured incom
ing parties. From Japan there are representatives of the
Yokohama Specie bank, Mitsui & Co., the Toyo Yusen Kai
â€™sha. the South Manchurian Railway Co. |
From China come Chiness business
men from 10 cities, including Tae

â€œSign or Die!â€ Man Says
Gunman Told Him
KELSO, June 23. Threatened
with a plstol unless he would sign
a mysterious document in the dead
of night Sunday, Willlam Woodruff,
Kelso citizen, Monday evening told
Luke 8. May, Seattle criminologisty
investigating the murder of Editom
Thomas Dovery, of the latest overt
act of violence in the political feud
which has torn this busy little mill
town wide open.
Woodruff escaped the stranger,
and his house was guarded until
daylight Monday by police detailed
by Chief Bronner.
Here is his story:
â€œl was walking home and had
reached a dark spot near Third and
Columbia streets, when accosted by
this man. He handed me a paper
and told me: â€˜Sign that petition.' [
said T would not until I could read ft.
I asked him to walk to the next are
light. He pressed a pistol into my
side and ordered me to sign it right
away. â€˜Sign that petition or I'll kill
vou,' he told me. â€˜lf you don't sign
it within 24 hours, you'll be next,â€™' he
added.
â€œJust then I heard footsteps down
the street and the man ran away
in the shadows. I ran home and
called the police.'â€
When two officers arrived they
found the frightened manâ€™'s home
darkened. As they walked up tha
sidewalk they heard footsteps rape
{dly retreating at the rear. Thinking
it was Woodruff, they called, but
got no response. Then Woodruff hes.
itated, opened the door and called
out that someone had been walking
around and around his house. An
officer remained on guard all the
rest of the night.
May is at a loss to explain the
affair, but admits his belief that ifÂ§
had something to do with the present
political warfare here.
Whoever assassinated Editor
Thomas Dovery here Friday
night, first dealt him a brutal
blow and then shot the prostrate
man in the shoulder. That pre
cludes the theory of holdup, first
advanced by Dovery's political
enemies, because money and
hank checks in the murdered ed
itor's pockets were untouched.
Discovery of a bruise on the back
of Dovery's skull and a cut on the
left side of his face near the mouth
was made by Luke S, May, Seattls
eriminologist, and Dr. Norris, in an
wutopay late Monday afternoon.

â€œThe grand jury confesses, with certain

suredly it is to be deplored that neglect
and irresponsibility of life in and out

to be blamed for the fact that the morals
and morality of a considerable number of
the younger generation have deteriorated
to that condition where youths and maid

PRESIDENT COOLIDGE, after a

the tariff commission's recommendation
that the tariff on sugar be reduced, large

treasury $40,000,000.
It is a method of economizing with the
least amount of audible squealing. The
millions of sugar eaters who pay the
$40,000,000 donâ€™t declare their hurt and,
of course, big sugar business is quietly
happy.
Simply, the costly tariff commission,
which is supported by the sugar eaters,

miles at sea, and the.islands blazed away
at it for several hours before it made

Altho admittedly not up in war strat

In 1816 there was a killing frost during
every month of the year. The only corn
matured in Vermont that year was nursed
thru the summer with the aid of huge
bonfires. That year is still known in Ver
mont as â€œthe mackerel year,â€ for so poor
were the crops that farmers were obliged
to barter what they could scrape together
for mackerel to sustain them thru the
winter. No pork feed was raised, hence
the hogs died early in great distress,
June 17, 1816, a snowstorm swept
across the Northern states. In the East
ern states, by nightfall, roads were
blocked with snowdrifts. From three to
five inches of snow fell thruout New
York and New England, and a survey
showed that nearly every crop north of
the Potomac river was ruined. This was
a real winter snowstorm, and, there was
another one almost as severe on August
80. The frosts extended as far south as
North Carolina.
The unseasonable weather of 1816 was
also marked by the appesrance in the

jury of Clatsop county, Oregon, has as

9, A. D, 1925, the Clatsop county grand
jury returned the following finding:
â€œThe grand jury confesses, with certain
and sorrowful regret, that the preponder
ance of deliberation was given to the con
sideration of juvenile delinquency. As
suredly it is to be deplored that neglect
and irresponsibility of life in and out

to be blamed for the fact that the morals
and morality of a considerable number of
the younger generation have deteriorated
to that condition where youths and maid

PRESIDENT COOLIDGE, after a
year's sincere consideration, rejects
the tariff commission's recommendation
that the tariff on sugar be reduced, large
ly because the reduction would cost the
treasury $40,000,000.
It is a method of economizing with the
least amount of audible squealing. The
millions of sugar eaters who pay the
$40,000,000 donâ€™t declare their hurt and,
of course, big sugar business is quietly
happy.
Simply, the costly tariff commission,
which is supported by the sugar eaters,
laid an egg that spoiled in the hatching.

at it for several hours before it made

In 1816 there was a killing frost during
every month of the year. The only corn
matured in Vermont that year was nursed
thru the summer with the aid of huge
bonfires. That year is still known in Ver
mont as â€œthe mackerel year,â€ for so poor
were the crops that farmers were obliged
to barter what they could scrape together
for mackerel to sustain them thru the
winter. No pork feed was raised, hence
the hogs died early in great distress,
June 17, 1816, a snowstorm swept
across the Northern states. In the East
ern states, by nightfall, roads were
blocked with snowdrifts. From three to
five inches of snow fell thruout New
York and New England, and a survey
showed that nearly every crop north of
the Potomac river was ruined. This was
a real winter snowstorm, and, there was
another one almost as severe on August
80. The frosts extended as far south as
North Carolina.
The unseasonable weather of 1816 was
also marked by the appesrance in the

Of Mexico's 14,000,000 citizens,
12,000,000 are impoverishod peas
ants, moetly illiterate peons of
Indlan origin. Under Dictator
Diaz, 98 per cent of these wers
landless,
There were many princely es
tates with hundreds of thousanda
of wores. A dozen ranged from
2,000,000 to 30,000,000 acres, or
from bigger than Jthode Island
or Delaware to larger than the
state of Ohlo. In the state of
Morelos 33 pecople owned 99 per
cent of all the land

order to get for himself and fam

usually had to go to work for
some big haclenda, or ranch,

pittance of pay, have his plot of
ground taken from him for debt,
then work the rest of his life to
pay the balance. He becams vir
tually a slave.
Henee the word peonage in our
own langunge.
President Madero, who suc
oceeded Diaz, was the first to
ses Mexico could never be a real
nation so long as such a system
prevalled. Ie triad to change
it, but was murdered, Then fol
lowed a number of revolutions
until Mexico was given a new
constitution in 1917, while Car

Article 27 of that constitution
called for a land reform. Obre

ocessors in office, have been try
ing to put it thru,
Mont Maxican peasants live In
clusters, or small villages, for
better protection, water supply
and the like. There nro some
15,000 such villuges. The prin
cipal {dea of the land roform Is
to add to the village â€œcomnmons,â€
or â€œejidos,â€ enough land so that
each family may have a few
acresâ€”ranging from 7 to 08
acres, depending upon fertility
of the soll,
As each village would recelve
on an average some 5,000 acres,
the very larpe estates stand to

the other hand, the moderats

wiped out, since the law guar

is that no great reform such as
this has ever been accomplished
without esome injuctices being
done.
Calles says he â€œwill never be a

There's only one point in your

â€œThis abovs all: To thine osm

Of course, a diploma is a fine

And there may be cheer and en

Navy Beats Huskies in

Thrilling Crew Finish
BY P. J. WALSH
o (Star Staff Carrespondent)
POL(:HKEEPSIE. N. Y., June 23.â€”Amid the piercing
calls of a fleet of United States destrovers anchored
near the finish line, the Annapolis Navy eight nosed out
the University of Washington by three quar
ters of a boat length Monday, in what will
go down as one of the greatest rowing races
of all time here.
More than 60,000 people were on their feet
when these powerful crews came under the
Poughkeepsie bridge neck and neck. The
Navy challenged and Washington answered;
both crews were cutting the water 34 strokes
to the minute. The Huskies fought bravely,
but the Midshipmen bent to and crossed the
line a winner, with only four seconds of time
separating them as they went under the
CALLOW

cvavy was clocked at 19 minutes 24 and 4-5 seconds to 19
mi s 28 seconds for the Huskies.
ï¬unsin came from behind in the final stretch to take
third place, while Jim Riceâ€™s Penn eight, after a gallant
fight for the first two miles.{ .
fell back into fourth place
and clung there. Cornell fin-I
ished fifth, Syracuse sixth e
and Columbia a miserable
last.
Junior
Varsity Won
Rusty Callow tasted his first de.
feat, but aitho his crew was beaten,
the boys who came 3,000 miles to
race, were not outclassed.
Callow, however, has something to
be joyful over, and that is the sen.
sational junjor varsity victory over
& field of five starters, coming from
third place fn the last mile to show
their backs to Pepn and Cornell.
Getting back to thes varsity class,
#t was twilight when the saven

up in place. Julian Curtis, referee,
yelled, â€œReady, ali,â€ and seven cox
swains raised their arms in acknowl
edgement. The crack of a pistol
was heard and the crews wers off.
Navy got awsy Lo a poor start
and after three hard strokes
signaled for a new start. The
crews lined up again, The
Huskies, in lane 5, paddled slow
ly back to the course. The new
start was made with the Navy
_getting the jump again, This
time they were off. Johnny
Doyle was shoving his Penn
boat up with the midshipmen for
100 yards. Navy led by a nose,
with Penn second and Wiscon
sin third. At the mile the navy
was ahead, but Washington
had jumped Penn. The stroke
was being raised and Penn could
not meet it
Washington and the Navy wers |

stretch, and there was not three feet |
between the crews as the bndni

structure, both crews gave all thcyl
had, but al! Washington had wasn't
quite enough.

The five destroyers sent up dis

and the entire crowd on the observa.

up the gap and was closing in fast
when the midshipmen flashed over
the line the winner. Both crews
going down the home stretch were
hit a 4 44 stroke. On the paddle
ï¬‚b the boathouse Washington
sorsd from end to end of the
observation train, while Navy, too,
was given a big ovation by the
erowid.
The race was a heart-breaker
and never hefore have two more
evenly matched crews fought for
a title here. No new course rec
ord was established but, with the
winning of the race, the Navy
wrested the national champlon
ship from the Huskies. Conch

McCarey Tells How Johneon Predicted Round in
Which He Would Stop Jack Jeffries, and He
Turned Trick; Johnson Marvelously Clever
BY T. J. (â€œUNCLE TOM"â€) McCAREY
Famous old-Time Promoter
IM JEFFRIES seconded his brother Jack
J in the latter's match with Jack Johnson
at the old Century Athletic club in Los An
geles,
I have told how Johnson, unknown to me,
first wrote from Bakersfield and later came
down here and, after securing credit thru
me, caused a sensation about town with his
glad rags.
. Jack by now was becoming very popular,
He possessed a cheerful personality, was
witty and a great mixer. Everyone liked
him. There was nothing fresh about him,
but he was breezy and willing to exchange
I bantering with the best of them,
. But before getting to the bout with Jack Jeffries, I must
'tell of an interesting incident which had its beginning prior
'to the battle,
. With John Brink, the famous restaurant man (who since
has passed away) I was sitting at Pitcher brothers. The
Pitcher boysâ€™ place was headquarters for the club.
- Brink and I were having our shoes shined and chatting.
' Artie Pitcher called over to us, â€œHere comes the Big Smoke!â€
Brink spoke up. He was quick and I were sitting together when it
on things like that. usuâ€˜rthumr time for the fifth round
| making out a couple of tickets
lat 100 to 70 in favor of Jack
| Jeffries, quick!â€
8o when Johnson eame up Artle
was just finishing writing out the
tickets and Johnsen noticed him. |
Right away he spoke up, "â€œ"What's'
that, what you.aull betting on?" |
Wa let on like we didn't wan! him
to see the tickets and Artie Pitcher
tried to turn them over. Finally
Brink rather reluctantly said to
Pitcher, â€œLet him see it. | don't
care,â€
. . .
Johnson Predicts Knockout
APâ€˜TI-:R Johnson looked at it he
started to laugh and sald,
â€œLawdy, Lawdy, Mr, Brink and Mr.
Tom. Have youwll lost your sense
that you did have?â€ Then he turned
to Pitcher:
â€œMr. Art, you go Inside there
- and get me a blank plece of
~ paper and an envelope. 1 am
going to write on that piece of
paper Just what round the cham-
I plon, Mr. Jim Jeffries, Is going
to carry Il brother Jack out.â€
Then he added, â€œNow, Mr. Tom,
don't open that envelope until the
night of the fight and then, when
Irou see me look over to you and
amile, and say, â€˜Now, Mr. Tom, open
that envelope,â€ then open it."
- . .
He Had It Doped Right
SLâ€™RE enough! The night of the
fight camas around. Johnson was
