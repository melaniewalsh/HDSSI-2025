INTRODUCTION
HE poems in this volume are almost entirely
the work of students who were enrolled last
year in the verse-writing course offered by
the English department under my instruction. Be-
tween October 1923 and June 1924 about thirty
undergraduates took this course, and more than
half of them composed poems which I consider
worthy of preservation.
The course is conducted in a laboratory man-
ner. It meets for a two hour period one afternoon
each week, and the class time is devoted to a critical
examination of the poems submitted by the class the
previous week. The poems are reproduced by mimeo-
graph and a copy placed in the hands of each stu-
dent. There is no anonymity of authorship; each
poem is signed by the author with his real name. We
have never found that this frankness tended to in-
hibit criticism; the very best spirit has always pre-
vailed, even when critical attacks have grown most
spirited.
My purpose as instructor has been to hold before
the class two ideals: originality and beauty. Poems
which had neither of these qualities were dismissed
instantly as unworthy of consideration. Regarding
both theme and form I have granted the fullest
liberty, urging, however, that the writer strive within.
the limits of his emotional experience.
It will at once become obvious to the reader of
this book that free verse forms dominate. This is
7

not due to any bias of my own. It is partly ex-
plained, I think, by the fashion of the time, and
partly by a fundamental desire among young writers
to avoid conventionality. The expert manipulation
of classical forms is something which can well come
with maturity. The chief consideration in the en-
couragement of immature poets is, I believe, the de-
velopment of their poetic imagination—their ability
to see life in terms of beauty and to express it in
vital concrete images. Looser verse forms allow the
creative mind to concentrate upon the image. Rhythm
will appear as a necessity; metre will come later as
a self-imposed restriction; rhyme as a strengthening
bond and an adornment. To ask a young student to
grasp all the principles of poetry at once is to ask an
impossibility. It becomes a matter of personal opin-
ion, then, which principles should be considered first.
In this matter I have not hesitated. I have no desire
to read doggerel, and that is what I should be doing
a great deal of the time were I to begin with rhyme
and meter rather than with images.
I do require, on the other hand, that sometime
during his first few weeks of writing, the student
compose a sonnet and a poem in one of the restricted
French forms-a lesson in classicism certain to pro-
duce humility.
Each man to his method; the only virtue is in
the result.

SPRING RAIN
When it rains in spring,
The pelting into life
Of the earth-
Clay figure of a giant at rest---
Is like the awakening of a sleepy athlete
Under a blue shower bath;
Slow-moving stinging flesh
Stretches out with fumbling fingers,
Feels the body pulsing,
Shakes water-drops from a tousled head,
And draws deep breaths in the pain of waking.

MM OL
OLDEST MOONLIGHT
Oldest moonlight drops from a full moon
Just before dawn.
It conceals nothing
But spreads
With such heavy silver glare
That my sight is blurred,
And I look at a new silent land
In loneliness and fear.
14


## p. 15 (#21) ##############################################

Berenice DuRae
COLOR OF AN ECHO
The color of an echo
That quivers at dusk
Between great crags
Of jagged black marble
And then bounds against the sunset
Is purple.
It streaks across the sky
Only for an instant
And disappears-
The color of an echo
From a narrow silver horn.

EVENING
There is something sad
In the last hour of day
When the trees stop bending and breathing
And nothing is heard
But the sleepy chirp of a robin
And two frogs singing
Down by the still pond.
Then I think the small white moon
Is like a lonesome rabbit
Sitting in a meadow of shadows
Waiting for the night.
16


## p. 17 (#23) ##############################################

Berenice DuRae
SIMILE
Trees before a rain
Are like big birds
Twittering among themselves
And preening their feathers
Preparatory to humping over
And hushing
To receive the downpour.

Berenice DuRae
COLOR
Waterfalls are pink
In the morning
Over red rocks.
Rose petals
Of a delicate goddess
Scattered in spray.
Your heart's color
Beating in your cheeks.

CONTEMPLATION
When summer comes
With its slow moving rivers
And its great calm trees
Full of round green leaves,
Flawless,
Content,
Matured,
Then my mind is like a tree bent
Over a river.

Berenice DuRae
CHINESE SINGER
You sit and sing,
A lifeless thing,
Plucking at your loose waxed thong
And suiting each long tone in your song
To the twangy ring
Of the sullen string!
Your eyes of ash
Are filled with rash
Strange thoughts that waveringly cling
To the quavering echo of your sounding string-
Mental trash
Begot of melodic clash!

HARBOR IN SPRING
The thoughts of a coolie
As he pads back and forth,
Back and forth,
From drab ship to drab land
Bearing countless burdens,
Monotonous burdens of tea—
The thoughts of a coolie are strange.
He thinks in the morning
Of the new shirt
Money will buy on pay day,
Shining silk
With a yellow stripe
To match the yellow shoes-
He will be very American.
But when unloading is done
And chill sweeps of black rise out of the sea,
The smell of the tea grows stronger.
Tea is to drink, not to carry.
Tea is to drink out of little cups, meditatively,
In a house of green
Where the mottoes are of blue silk-
It is not hard for a coolie
To think at night
Of a cherry-blossom house.

OLD MAN
Go away!
Wanton day,
Cavorting about my door,
With streaming hair and drunken glee,
Breathing fragrance from the Gilead tree,
Inviting one to play
Who plays no more.
Go away!

Berenice DuRae
LULLABY
Chunks of night are falling softly
Down on baby eyes;
Hunks of sleep are making pillows
To cuddle baby sighs.
Put your fist into your mouth
And you will dream of gold,
And wake up in the morning
To be another day old.
So stop hands creeping and eyelids peeping
And call the Dinky Dunks
To rock and sing and carry you off
To the Land of Hunks and Chunks.

MEMORIES
Your gown tonight reminds me
Of the way our old shingled shanty used to look
Just after a rain,
When the red in the shingles came out
And shone in the sun against the brown.
And the way you carry your graceful lean body
Makes me think of the firs
That rose above the moss covered roof
Swaying in the wind.
I am restless with wondering tonight,
Because the light in your dark eyes
Is like the candle tip
That stood in the shanty window after dark
To welcome me home.

Berenice DuRae
THE FIRST SPRING MORNING
I saw a ballad singer pluck a primrose
On going down the highway into town,
The morning that the blue bird sang. Who knows
But that it's these things we call Spring? A clown,
A bird, a rose, a ballad singer and
A sweet wind blowing steadily from the south,
Clearing months-old cobwebs from the land,
Changing frost to dewdrops at earth's mouth.
I saw a primrose and a ballad singer
Go into town in early morning. A thing
To be remembered. Why, winter will not linger
When blue and yellow shout that it is Spring,
And a clown can find a theme for verse in air
That blows from waking meadows fragrance rare.

PICTURES FROM AN OFFICE WINDOW
I
No grass grows in the city,
But the sky sometimes
In wind-blown streaks
Keeps the color of a new-sprung grass blade
Growing in the shade of a board walk.
When it rains,
II
The puddle at the corner
Is the receptacle
Of leaping berries
Thrown down hard from the sky.
III
This is the Street of Hats
That weave a pattern all day long
With splashy color,
Separating at night to return
Each to its individual hat-box.
The dark is a swan,

And her goslings are cities
Whose cries are hushed
And whose eyes drop shut
Under safe warm wings.

TRIAD
I
Petals of cyclamen
Are like fire-
Fire that rises in purple flames.
I think my heart could at last be warmed
If it were enveloped
In the purple flames of cyclamen.
Jealous thoughts

Are like dwarfed pines
In Japanese gardens:
They might have grown to thoughts
Of love.

The willow tree is a feather fan
Through which the moon coquettes.

Sometimes laden
With grey rolls of cloud,
Sometimes carrying
Black ropes of smoke
From chimneys.

The wind staggers
With ivory from the moon.

DISCOVERY
Soft . .
My spade sinks into the earth
And upturns a group
Of frightened Easter lilies.
Huddled close together
They are shrinking from the sunlight
And the cold March wind-
Little wax nuns
With white carved faces
Purifying themselves
In an underground dwelling.

Margaret Graefe
CONVALESCENT
My eyes are tired
Of building and rebuilding
Squares and crosses
On the checkered rug beside my bed.
Hour after hour
I have counted the carmine roses
On my chintz curtains-
Cotton roses—
That do not breathe the air,
Nor feel the sun
That ventures through the open window;
They never bloom. . . yet always fading
They never die.
The day is long.
I am eager for Night to pull down
The worn window blind
On the heavens;
So I can count the cracks
Where light shines through—
The cracks that men call stars.

Intense quiet...
RAIN
Then rain drops peck unevenly
On the tiled roof.
Like pellets of mercury
They hit the road
And gather coats of dust,
Unable to moisten the parched earth
They roll into the folds of dust
And lose themselves.
Long silver streaks of rain
Splotch the withering hollyhock leaves.
Intense silence again
Then the wind
Like the voice of an exhausted priestess
Cries for rain.
Again uneven drops strike the roof,
The road-dust and the hollyhock leaves,
Till the odor of the dusty earth
Rises like incense
On the heavy air.
Then faster, faster . . .
The rain comes
With a majestic sweep
And quenches the altar fires of earth.

END OF AN APRIL SHOWER
I
Long caravans of cloud
Travel across
The eastern desert
Of the sky.
Perhaps these lakes
And hills of earth
Are a mirage—
Or do they see
More verdant oases
On other worlds?

A long black cloud,
Like the outstretched wing
Of a raven,
Covers half the setting sun.

REINCARNATION
A bumble bee
In black and gold
Walked proudly
Down the white wax veins
Of a lily petal,
Toward the heart of the flower.
Under the transparent pistil
He paused
And drank the honey
That dripped
From this inner fountain.
Long ago, on Mt. Olympus,
Mercury sipped nectar
From a jeweled cup.

INDECISION
Pour rain!
Wash these mouldy grey thoughts
From my mind.
Dash rain!
Against my clay-hid eyes.
Pelt down silver streaks of storm!
Beat my murky reasoning
As you are slashing the soot-laden limbs
Of this fir tree.
Blacken clouds!
And grow more black, my thoughts,
Until your suffocating weight
Will burst in showers.

Plump haws
WARNING
Clinging on a hawthorn hedge;
Fat over-aged berries,
Bursting your dark maroon suits;
(You who escaped the snow-birds,
Robins refuse for worms)
Know you not
That maroon is for grey skies
And winter?
No color for lovers
Of daffodils
•
They smile as you nod and wink
At them from the hedge,
But hie you, old clowns,
For on May day
Ballet girls
In silver-petaled frocks
Will toe you
And laugh at your dotage.

SILVER FORESTS
A silver forest, in summer,
Bleaches on the mountain side;
Like spears—
With their hilts
Grounded in the sunny slope-
But in March
These trees will strike
And gash the face of the wind.

PERSPECTIVE
At noon,
As I walk
Under tall poplars
By a bell tower,
The chimes are clanging
And jarring
Against the bare tree limbs.
At evening,
As I stand
Under poplars
That quiver
Near a moonlit pond,
The bells are weaving
Their evening song
Into the black lace
Of the tree branches.

YOUR EYELIDS
Your eyelids
Are the wings of a blue-white moth,
Veined with thin dark lines.
When I tease or anger you
The covers of your eyes
Flutter and beat-
The struggle of a moth
Captured between two fingers.
When I sit and dream with you
In the moonlight,
Your eyelids
Tilt and balance-
A milk-white butterfly
At rest on blue larkspur.

TO MY PEACOCK FEATHER PEN
When I write letters to my friend
You watch. I glance, but know
Your peacock eye will shyly bend
In guilt-your tar-black eye, with courage
Will pretend
To sleep. I write-with slow
Clear eye you read the words that flow
Onto this page.
You may be one of Argus' eyes.
The way you nod and blink
Your glossy pupil looks so wise,
Your gold light fades to green, violet-glazed.
My sighs
Blow you, whose quill can drink
The wine of this deep purple ink
And not be dazed.

A WATERFALL
Mad white horses, why run racing
Down this sheer steep,
Mingling your manes with the spray as you leap?
Is a thundering death in the vortex so sweet
That you hasten to meet-and keep your tryst?
Mad white horses, why gallop-chasing a mist?

WILLOW
I watch you from the darkness
As you dance--
A slender willow
Swaying to the winds of syncopation.
Some cut wild willow trees
To feed their fires,
But I would watch you
From the night of darkened seats
Dancing in the sunrise of footlights,
Swaying to the winds of syncopation.

BRONZE FISH
Bronze fish in a pool,
Faint ochre moon-glints shading brown water,
Water so old and calm that the night wind,
Tiptoeing to the edge, looks and laughs
A shivery, soft chuckle,
And moves away to sleep in burnt bracken.
While the gold leaves, one by one, silently,
Slip from the dark trees,
The bronze fish shimmer and watch the moon.

SPEECH
God gave men no words to tell of the sunset;

AUTUMN
The bare willow branches stand against the sky

SUPPLICATION
Winds that kiss the sea and make it bloom
With petals of foam opening on green hearts,
Breathe upon the grey stretch of my gloom;
Press upon it cold until it parts.
Winds that redden the sides of fruit by day,
And seem to spray the silvered skies by night,
Blow through my garden on your rising way;
Wash my heart with color and delight.

WILD HORSES
The blue sky clears itself of night,
And through the springing grasses of the land
Run the wild horses of the morning light,
Flank rubbing flank, in a thin curved band.
They swerve in a white tunnel overhead
And vanish like a leaf on malachite.
The sweat their rolling heated sides have shed
Is poised on the grass points like balls of light.
The moon, a dancer slim in silver tights
And rigid limbed on one great gleaming back,
Mounts gloriously to the bluest heights-
Is lost among the wild and stamping pack.

SOPHISM
I have seen a grey gull float above a sky-red bay.
One moment-the world turned grey.
I have seen above wet leaves, massed blackberries
burn-
Then drop as the winds turn.
I have seen the wind and rain flash through the
dark glade
Of your eyes-and fade.
My love for you can not be real:
It holds too fast: it is too still.

PHOSPHORUS
The midnight sky rests heavily on black hills;
Jet rocks compress a narrow ebony sea;
A dark bird circles near the ship and fills
The shrouded chasm with a mystery.
The ship cuts through the gorge a silver track,
Forward, aft, the hull burns white and cold,
The stem splits shining water smoothly black
In diamond spray and curving leaves of gold.

WATERFALLS
Slim white hands
Caress the rocks
With dripping fingers,
Or festoon strings of pearls
From sharpened crags,
Or drop silk tassels
Into still blue lakes,
Or shake white curtains
Into deep abysses.

LONELINESS
My heart aches with the beauty
Of spring beside my door,

And live again no more!
Her soft green gown of wonder
Blows from her throat so white-
While I sit, empty-hearted,
In the silence of the night.

A bolder thing than this:

NIGHT WIND
I can not sleep tonight;
Is it the wind?
For night brings wind,
With long black fingers
That twist and turn
My brain.
And the wind at night
Has heavy feet,
As it stalks through the room,
And hurls its cold harsh breath
Against me.
My eyes close with weariness,
But the wind shrieks fiendishly,
Torturing me with memories.

THE STORM
The black waters are lashed into waves
Made glorious by their silver crowns;
The trees repeat the shriek and the wail of the

And bend and sway in terror,
As in its fury it sweeps the rain
From the dark glistening pavement,
And sends it racing back to the sea.

COLORS
I am setting up my palette
With the colors that I love.
Long silver tubes
Fat and full of paint
Squeezed in my fingers
Loosen worms of color
To wriggle
On to my polished wood palette.
First I shall put on
Alysirian crimson,
Rose madder,
Crimson lake,
And Chinese vermilion.
To paint the red things I love.
The sleek coats of red horses,
Japanese lacquer boxes,
Stamps on white note paper,
The coral fuzziness for salmon berries,
Smoke-softened suns,
Shiny red leather note books,
Rabbits' eyes,
Agates,
And your painted lips.
Then I shall take green,
Emerald green

Lime drops,
And your cat-eyes.
Then I shall take
Yellow ochre
And citron
To paint the yellow things I love.
New butter,
A bee's pollened legs,
Faded parchment,
Ripe straws,
Water lilies and lemon skins,
Topaz tiger eyes and ears,
The damask wall you lean against.
Then I shall use blue,
Cerulean blue,

To paint the pale things that I love.
Stripped alder trees,

SUN
Sun
Covers the ground like snow
Heavy and soft.
Oil-smooth as honey,
It drips
From the leaves of lazy trees
And glaces
Lush fruits with sweetness;
Leaden and slow
Pouring out on the water
Like molten metal
To weigh down the waves.
Even I am gilded
•
A statue sun-bathed.
Riffle of wind,
And the gold on the trees
Flies off in the air
Like diamond dust.
Wind-and the waves
Flash from the lake like sequins
The scales of many silver fish.
I shake...
Oh wind, what have you done to me?

Are fat and sleek,
For they lap up the cream
Where it happens to leak.
They lead a life of indolence and ease.
They bathe in butter
And sleep on cheese.
But the worst of having such well-fed cats—
They tolerate mice
And make friends with the rats!

GIANT
Brave I walk among the dandelions,
And swish the tall weeds as my careless tread
Falls on daisies white and daisies red.
Small notice do I give to berry vines
But crush them down regardless of the wines
That stain my feet. With one step I behead
A beetle, make a caterpillar shed
His fur, and rout red ants that march in lines.
I am proved a god by these great deeds;
Laying low the grass and scattering seeds,
Crushing small-sized jungles in my wake.
All a giant's pleasure shall I take
While walking with my head up in the sky
Where there are giants larger still than I.

THE SEARCH
Softly as fox feet
And swiftly as faun
We slipped up the road
Hunting for the morning,
Searching for the dawn,
Peering through the petals
Of night closed flowers
To find
Its sleeping place,
Peeping through hunchbacked trees
To surprise its timid face.
We even searched
In the long tree moss
And crept through the silken stems
Of meadow grass;
But it was hidden fast
And if in the dark
Dawn slipped behind us,
We did not hear it pass.
And wide we ran
And close we searched
Until our steps were forced and slow.
Then back the same dark road
We lurched
Homeward, grey with dust,
And cursed ourselves for fools

AUGUST NIGHT IN A CITY
The enormous steel structure of night
Is being riveted down by myriad crickets.
It is alive with batwinged workmen
Piling blackened girders-criss-cross-
Up into the dark.
And the stars, dripping fire,
Are tossed across the sky by careless giant hands;
White-hot bolts to impale the dark
And build a black stone apartment house
For angels.

THE FIRST NIGHT OF SPRING
The world is hushed
For this
Is the first night of spring.
The world lies quiet
Lest, turning too often,
The loveliness be crushed.
It lies in an ecstatic swoon,
Not daring to breathe
Lest the frost
Of winter still in its lungs
Should tarnish the sheen
And wither the new green moon.
The earth is still;
All song
Is hushed lest the magic
Be broken. Trees halt quietly
Their swaying, and soft lies
Every hill.
A stillness is cast
On the water
And mists hover, afraid to fall,
Afraid to bruise or break
The fragility of this night
That cannot last.

Breathless

I swam to this,

Are as dark and smooth
As the glass
Of a wine bottle-
Green glass
Which seaweed films
With cobwebs.
Here I pause.
Ashine with bubbles,
Frosted with foam,
Atilt
In a delicious young fear
Fear that the dark water
Will dim my whiteness,
That strange things
Will float against
My softness.

Before you leap
Atop the wall of night and touch
The eyes of those that sleep;
Touch them gently,
Touch them softly with the long yellow straws

At dawn and cast to the daws
At noon.

As the harvest of sorrows I reap tonight.
Strange the difference
Between darkness and light.

If it were only my heart

Waiting only for invitation
Before coming like gracious ladies
Down the stately stairways of my mind.
But tonight my brain throbs;
So I carefully lock all doorways
Lest the witches of hysteria creep forth
And, running swiftly down upon me
From the darkened stairways,
Catch me unawares
And snare me in their nets-
Their black nets of madness.

A SONNET
At first we walked; then bolder, ran-until
Our feet grew flying fins to buoy us free
Upon the damp of night's deep purple sea.
With lengthened stride we ran and stars stood still
And all the trees on one green low-slung hill
Seemed but a darkened continuity
Of lines which backward raced like infantry
Retreating from some dark and ghostly drill.
On we ran and breathless grew with speed.
But space was fixed. All earth sped faster far
Than glittering planet, moon, or frozen star.
We ran, and knew the heavens were congealed
Until you stopped, careless of word or deed,
To draw me close; and then-the heavens reeled.

THE GLOVE SALE
Elbow upon a velvet-padded stand,
She sits; selects, decides most shopper-wise
On color and on feel. A glove she tries
Of softest kid; it slips upon her hand
And closes tight with button and with band.
She carefully considers price and size;
Consults her purse and then she buys.
She sees a bargain. I see pasture land,
Hear pipes. Her finger tips are hoofs that tap
And beat a tattoo on the counter ledge.
Clad in skin of goats her hands have grace
Of satyrs. Drunk with beauty and the chase,
They stampede, whirl until they reach the edge,
Tense-and leap to death within her lap.

UNHAPPINESS
Unhappiness is grey,
Holding as many shades
And depths as incense
Whose vapors smother
With chiffon-soft veils;
Unhappiness is grey,
Mauve and many-colored;
The smoke that reddens the moon,
The noon-dust that cools the sun.
Many colors are mixed
For a perfect grey, and yet
Some colors are always grey.
Age sees unhappiness
Only another shadow
In an evening filled with shadows;
Youth sees grey as dark and bitter :
Mould on scarlet cherries,
Road-dust on roses.

A REGRET
Grey against glitter;
Unhappiness spreads ominous wings
Against a naive sky
And freezes my heart with fear
For the morrow.
The cruelty of words
Laden with anger and insolent pride of youth
Tears the gentleness
Of sun-lulled sleep and soft winds,
Rends the scarce sounds of morning
With piteous wails
That no one hears.
The acidity of regret
Eats the gold of the sunlight
And I cannot weep.
Tides of sorrow engulf me
And I clutch
At the meagre straws of remembrance;
His eyes were as blue and as young
As the morning.

ICONOCLAST
To write a sonnet one should sit and sigh
And think of love; of beggar maids and kings;
Cupid, and all such pale and pastel things:
Of willow trees above a brook, and cry
That for the flash and smile of a bright blue eye
He would perish. One sits with harp in hand and
sings
Of buds that will bloom again for a thousand
springs.
Some would make sonnets so.
But not so, I.
I shall write about the slim green moon
That dips its pointed nose into a lake
Of rolling orange, swinging to the tune
Of myriad crickets, purple-winged, who take
Their songs from sighing firs of black. A moon
That tosses fish to fat stars in her wake.

Upon the earth the cool soft-fingered rain
Stirs innuendoes of awakening
And makes hushed tremors shyly preluding

The garden's swathed in sheets of misty stain
And lies all tremulous and listening
But restless as a sleeping moth's grey wing
With dreams of yellow crocus buds again.
Beneath a mask of other thoughts and still
As lilies, unawakened, pooled in dew
Deep hidden, my heart keeps an old dream, too;
I thought I had forgotten it until
A bird's wing flashed about a thrawn, black tree,
And startled-I remembered suddenly.

And a whimsical sigh of the sea;

Over the world at dawn;
But when the tall trees reach to me
I am gone.
I am the song the white birch sings
By the pool in the woods at night,
And the whir of a wild bird's wing at dusk
Just aflight.

And the thought of the restless sea-
Oh, the whole wide earth is a wistful cry
Calling me.

Disillusioned.

Slender as a poplar tree,

It tilted lightly through the sky,

Loving them as I love you.
At last it tottered, fast asleep,
And splashed into the lake;

And strewn upon the water
Were silver slivers from its hair.

To keep the stuff of stars in gleaming throes.

As its scintillating colors fell and rose,

What gay chaotic gardens
Yet unknown,
Are visioned with the faintest
Fragrance blown
By changing winds on strange seas
When gray night
Retires and on green waves the rosy
Nympths alight.

RELIEF
At last
In the dense quiet
Of the darkened room,
A wild bee buzzed,
And guided by a glint of sunlight,
When a stray breeze
Lifted the close-drawn blind,
Flew to the pale mound of blossoms
Heaped on the coffin.

CHERRY TREE IN MARCH
Like the sea
Its thin green color
Glistens wet in the sunlight
And splashes out
In white blossoms
Of foam.
